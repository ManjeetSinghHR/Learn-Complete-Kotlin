# Learn-Complete-Kotlin
<p>In this forum, we will delve into comprehensive discussions on various Kotlin programming language concepts.
Our aim is to enhance our proficiency in Android development by exploring these concepts in depth.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Kotlin --></h2>
<p>--> It's a new programming language by Jet-Brains.</p>
<p>--> Jet-Brains developed software like - Android Studio, IntelliJ Idea, Pycharm etc.</p>
<p>--> Kotlin is a modern replacement of java programming language.</p>
<p>--> Java all features are available in kotlin, some features are improved and some new features are also added in Kotlin.</p>
<p>--> Like java, kotlin also runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</p>
<p>--> We can also use kotlin where we use java, because output of both are same.</p>
<p>--> We can create android apps as well as native apps with Kotlin.</p>
<p>--> We can also create apps from Mac-OS and Linux with the help of Kotlin.</p>
<p>--> We can also convert kotlin code into javascript with the help of compiler.</p>
<p>--> We can code complete ecosystem in kotlin from frontend to backend.</p>

<h2>History of Kotlin --></h2>
<p>--> In 2011, Jet-Brains announced the development of kotlin.</p>
<p>--> In 2012, Made it open source.</p>
<p>--> Kotlin first version 1.0 was live in 2016.</p>
<p>--> Google announced in 2017, that we can create android apps also in kotlin.</p>
<p>--> In 2019, Google makes kotlin as a Primary Language for android development.</p>

<h2>Features of Kotlin --></h2>
<p>Statically Typed Language --> It means when we type any code, compiler checks the code in compile time instead of run time. 
It help us to prevent errors in compile time. For E.g. - If we create a variable of Integer type and wants to pass a String 
value, then the compiler gives error and didn't accept the value.</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented and Functional Language --></h2>
<p>It's an object-oriented programming language which means it includes all oops concepts like objects & classes. It's also a functional 
language means all the functions like - lambdas, higher order functions, first class function also available in Kotlin.</p>

<h2>100% Interoperable with Java --></h2>
<p>It's a main feature of kotlin. We can call java code in kotlin and kotlin code in java as well. 
In a same project we can use both kotlin & java code.</p>

<h2>Concise, Safe and Powerful --></h2>
<p>It's a concise language, which means lines of code are minimum as compare to another language. It's a safe and powerful language 
because there is very fewer chances of errors in runtime. It gives errors in compile time, also protect us from 
"Null pointer exception", "class caste exception"</p>

<h2>Open Source --></h2>
<p>It's an open source language which means we can see what actually running behind the code. We can also contribute if we want.</p>

<h2>Development Environment Setup & Install IntelliJ --></h2>
<p>--> For development, we need - Java (at-least JDK 8) & IntelliJ Idea (Community Edition)</p>
<p>--> Why Java (JDK) - because kotlin is a JVM Language, so we need JDK.</p>
<p>--> JDK includes some libraries which help us to run kotlin code.</p>
<p>--> JDK - Java Development Kit</p>
<p>--> JVM - Java Virtual Machine</p>
<p>--> JRE - Java Runtime Environment</p>
<p>--> Important Note - In this entire course, we will be targeting JVM to learn kotlin concepts.</p>
<h2>How To Install --></h2>
<p>1. --> Search IntelliJ Idea and download community edition. Just install it after download.</p>
<p>2. --> Download & install Java "JDK" also, and set "Environment variable" in Setting of PC. [Need to set path of JDK]</p>
<p>That's all we need to run our kotlin code</p>
<h2>Run Kotlin code in VS-Code --></h2>
<p>We can also run our kotlin code in "VS-Code". For that we need some software and environment variable setup. 
Just follow the simple steps to run your kotlin code in "VS-Code" -</p>
<p>1. --> Search VS-Code, Download it & install.</p>
<p>2. --> Install 3 extensions in "VS-Code" - (a) - Kotlin, (b) - Kotlin Language, (c) - Code Runner</p>
<p>3. --> Search On Google - "Kotlin Command Line Compiler", Download it and extract the downloaded zip file.</p>
<p>4. --> After Extraction - copy the path "URL" and set its "Environment Variable"</p>
<p>5. --> To check success installation - open "CMD" and type "kotlin" and Press enter.</p>
<p>That's all we need to run Kotlin code in "VS-Code"</p>
